## Testing

* I have tested this website on both firefox and google chrome.

* I confirm the website is responsive when using devtools device toolbar.

* The navigation and header and footer all provide working links.

* The submit form accepts the valid inputs from the user and the submit buttom works.

## Bugs

* I encountered numerous bugs over the course of this project, many of which I resolved and some of which I could not. 

* One such bug I resolved was a persistant problem with the navigational links. I could not travel to the About or Further Listening areas from any pages other than the index page. I eventually discovered this was because I was using absolute file paths and has labeled a css selector the same as one of my nav id's. I changed the file paths from absolute and renamed the id and the navigational links began to work correctly. 

* One bug I have been unable to remedy is the movement of the image in the photorealistic emperor section when changing screen sizes. I attempted to use fixed positions, and edit the original photo, but could not prevent it from changing in an unwanted fashion.

## Validator testing

*HTML
  *The only error detected in HTML testing was in regard to the sign up form which when submitted didn't have a server to contact.

*CSS
  *One error was detected in the CSS regarding the column width in the gallery which I was unable to resolve.
